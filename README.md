There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Catalog, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.

## Whats Including In This Repository
We have implemented below **features over the GloboTicket-Microservices-Dapr repository**.

#### Catalog microservice which includes; 
* ASP.NET Core Web API application 
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* Repository Pattern Implementation
* Swagger Open API implementation	

#### Basket microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET Web API application
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **Redis database** connection and containerization
* Consume Discount **Grpc Service** for inter-service sync communication to calculate product final price
* Publish BasketCheckout Queue with using **MassTransit and RabbitMQ**
  
#### Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
* Containerization of microservices
* Containerization of databases
* Override Environment variables

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.Net Core 5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. Once Docker for Windows is installed, go to the **Settings > Advanced option**, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
* **Memory: 4 GB**
* CPU: 2
3. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```
3. Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

4. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:

* **EventCatalog API -> http://host.docker.internal:5001/swagger/index.html**
* **ShoppingBasket API -> http://host.docker.internal:5002/swagger/index.html**

* **Web UI -> http://host.docker.internal:5000**

6. Launch http://host.docker.internal:5000 in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to **call microservices over API Gateway**. When you **checkout the basket** you can follow **queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard**.

>Note: If you are running this application in macOS then use `docker.for.mac.localhost` as DNS name in `.env` file and the above URLs instead of `host.docker.internal`.
